          <p>
            We are ADVIZ, a strategic digital comms agency helping you create
            impact around the world. We help purpose-led organisations and the
            people that work for them around the world use digital tools to
            create and communicate positive social and environmental impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are problem-solvers and solution-finders, working closely with you
            to achieve your ambitions. We understand the challenges you face,
            have decades worth of experience under our belts, and are ahead of
            the curve with the latest digital trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like you, we want to use digital comms for social good, paving the
            way forward to a better world. We are people-centered, ethical,
            driven by our purpose, and are a proud B Corp.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aren’t fans of greenwashing, stunts and empty promises – and
            we’re determined to make a difference with you.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to help charities and NGOs, and the people that work
            for them, to make change happen.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            We want a world where charities and nonprofits have the support they
            need to tackle complex global challenges, in an ever-changing,
            increasingly volatile digital space.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can work as part of your team wherever you are in the world. We
            collaborate alongside you as colleagues, rather than at arms length
            – and we’re there when you need us.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Values</h3>
          <p>

            that share our values and our vision for a better world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, as an organisation working in the purpose-led space,
            our values are the foundation of the impact we create in the world.
          </p>

            together.
